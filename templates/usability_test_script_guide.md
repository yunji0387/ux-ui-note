## Introduction

Here, please introduce yourself and explain what you require them to do to participants.

Reassure them that they are not being tested and that you value their time and feedback. If you are recording the interview, give them a recording permission form to sign and let them know you will only use the recording internally and not share it with a third party.

- Example:
  
  <details close>

  Hi _________, how are you? I appreciate you taking time out of your day to participate in this session today. My name’s _______ and I’m _______(your role).

  Let me explain how this will work before we begin. I'd like to ask you some questions about yourself and your relevant experience. Then, you will examine the wireframe navigation. Once you've completed this, I'd like to hear your honest feedback about your experience with our online food delivery interface.

  You don't have to worry about making mistakes because we are only testing the navigation and functionality, not you. We're running this usability test to see how users interact with our service and collect their insights. It will be a big help to us.

  Is there anything else you want to ask before we get going?

  Finally, I’d like to ensure you’re comfortable with me recording today’s session. Is this okay with you? It’s recorded so I can be sure I have captured all your feedback. I'm only going to share it with our team internally and the data will only be used for improving the product, we won't share it with anyone outside. Is that ok with you?

  [Give them a recording permission form to sign]
    So I’ll now begin recording the audio and review some background questions

## Warm-up questions

Establish rapport with participants by asking them some general information questions like "Would you introduce yourself?" and "What is your occupation?" "What type(s) of mobile device(s) do you use?" etc.

## Screen tour

Give the participants an overview of what they are looking at and ask general questions. For example, you could ask: What do you think the screen is for?

## The tasks

Let participants know how you will guide them through the tasks. Give an overview of the tasks they are required to do. Remember, the test is on the navigation and functions offered by the screen. Write down the answers.

## Wrap-up questions and feedback

After each task, ask a few questions and conduct a rating exercise to elicit more feedback and information about the users' reasoning.

## Post-Test Interview

You don't have to ask many questions, but it's essential to have a few prepared. For example, an additional question could be: Was there anything you felt was missing or thought could have been better?

Answer any questions the participants may have.

Thank the participants.
