# Designing for accessibility

Accessibility enables people with disabilities to interpret, understand, navigate, interact with and contribute to the web. Think of a world in which developers know everything there is to know about accessibility. You design it and they build it perfectly. However, if you only consider the design of a product, it may make it difficult for people with disabilities to use it.

Choosing which 'needs' to design for is one of the most common issues when designing for accessibility. We don't intentionally exclude users; rather, 'we don't know what we don't know'. As a result, there is a lot to learn about accessibility. Let's consider some accessibility guidelines that may guide you in the right direction. These guidelines cover the major points you need to know for your products to be design-ready and meet the Section 508 and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 minimum standards. The rest is up to development and quality assurance testing. For a detailed explanation of accessibility, you can access the 
[WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/).

### Access to information is not a barrier to innovation

Accessibility may not persuade you to produce an ugly, boring or cluttered product. It may initiate a set of constraints you'll need to consider as you design. These design constraints will offer you new ideas to explore, resulting in improved products for all your users.

Bear in mind that you may not want to design for your peers as you read these guidelines. What is important is that you design for a wide range of users who will engage with your products, including people who are blind, color blind or have poor eyesight, those who are deaf or have poor hearing, people with permanent or temporary mobility impairments and people with cognitive disabilities. When you design, you may want to take all the possible users into consideration. They can be young, old, power users, casual users and those who purely enjoy a good experience.

### Don't use color alone to convey information

Don't use color alone to convey information. This may be useful for users who are unable or have difficulty distinguishing one color from another. People who are colorblind (1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women), have low vision (1 in 30 people) or are blind are included (1 in 188 people).

 While color can be used to convey information, it should not be the only way to do so. When using color to distinguish elements, it may be useful to provide additional identification that is not dependent on color perception. To indicate required form fields, you can use an asterisk in addition to color and labels to differentiate areas on graphs.

### Provide sufficient contrast between foreground and background

The contrast between the foreground and background colors must be sufficient. This includes text on images, gradient backgrounds, buttons and other elements. This does not apply to logos or incidental text, such as text found in a photograph. A contrast ratio between text and background of at least 4.5 to 1 is recommended in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. The minimum drops to 3 to 1 if your font is at least 24 pixels or 19 pixels bold.
